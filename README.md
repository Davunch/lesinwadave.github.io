**Key findings:** Transaction Trends by City 
Atlanta leads in transaction volume among the top 5 cities, followed by San Jose.These cities are high-priority regions for banking services, indicating strong customer engagement or dense population centers.
Transaction Channels Distribution: Transactions are evenly distributed across Online (32%), ATM (34%), and Branch (34%). The equal distribution highlights a balance in customer preference for digital and physical 
banking channels. It indicates the need for maintaining robust infrastructure in all three channels. Top 10 Account Balances:
The highest account balances are concentrated in a small group of accounts, suggesting a few premium customers who hold significant financial resources.These accounts represent high-value customers who might
benefit from tailored services and relationship management. Transaction Types: Debit transactions (77%) dominate over credit transactions (23%). This indicates higher outgoing financial activity, which could 
point to consumer spending trends or bill payments. Monthly Transactions by Occupation: Students account for the highest transaction volume compared to other occupations (Doctors, Engineers, Retired individuals).
This could suggest younger demographics are more active in day-to-day banking or financial transactions. Targeted campaigns for student banking products might be beneficial.
